# Classification of arrhythmias from single ECG signals  using a Convolutional Neural Network


### Steps overview
- Splitting dataset into training, validation, test sets
- Normalization
- Model architecture definition
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model training
- Performance evaluation (confusion matrix, Precision and Recall)


### More details
- wandb to track the experiments
- configuration files (possibility to change parameters by editing the json file without touching the code)
